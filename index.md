# An all about me page

My name is Nathan Chang, I am a **third year student** at UCSD currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science.

One of my favorite quotes is from the Bhagavad Gita, attributed to J Robert Oppenheimer in the construction of the atomic bomb 

> "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"

My favorite command is `git commit` because I get to leave funny little messages a `-m` tag.
